# unet-tf
UNET implemented in tf

Designed for a GIS road-detection data competition on Topcoder.

Final result:
Model can find roads, and supporting clustering technique can vectorize the segmentation.
See "scripts/post.py" for my open, MIT implementation of a raster-to-vector image converter for maps, a normally commercial functionality.
